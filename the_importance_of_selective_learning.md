# The Importance of Selective Learning

We are very lucky to live in a time in which new technologies emerge every day to help us build all sort of stuff and make our lives easier. There's always this awesome tool or language that you want to learn and use because it introduces a new way of thinking or a different paradigm.

And with today's access to information and learning resources, and if you know how to do your google search, you will find a plethora of resources to help you learn that tool or language and a plethora of many more things to learn. _It can get overwhelming_.


Learning is a skill in itself and those of us who are able to learn fast are blessed, but it's also important to remember that it's not a race. Learn at your own pace; as long as you're learning, you should take all the time you need. But before you embark on this journey of learning, you should take a moment to consider if you really need to invest all this time to learn this and/or that tool. Because _you can learn anything but you can't learn everything_; that's why you should be especially **selective** about what you learn.

There will always be temptations to start using this new language because of how awesome and revolutionary it is or how it will replace this other language, however, this doesn't mean that you should drop everything and start investing time to learn it. Take a step back and thoroughly think if you actually need to learn it.


Being selective about what you learn is how you distinguish yourself from others. _It is essentially about what you know well not how much you know_.


and remember to never stop learning!
